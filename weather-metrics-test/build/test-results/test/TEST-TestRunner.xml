Feature: Cucumber run test
  
    I want to run a sample feature file.

  Scenario: Cannot add a measurement without a timestamp ?[90m# 01-add-measurement.feature:20?[0m
    # POST /measurements
    ?[32mWhen ?[0m?[32mI submit a new measurement as follows:?[0m          ?[90m# AddMeasurementSteps.whenStatement(DataTable)?[0m
    ?[32mThen ?[0m?[32mthe response has a status code of 400?[0m           ?[90m# AddMeasurementSteps.thenNegativeSenario()?[0m

Feature: Get a measurement
  In order to learn what weather conditions were like at a specific time
  I want to be able to retrieve a measurement of several metrics at that time

  Background:                                           ?[90m# 02-get-measurement.feature:6?[0m
    # POST /measurements
    ?[32mGiven ?[0m?[32mI have submitted new measurements as follows:?[0m ?[90m# AddMeasurementSteps.givenStatement(DataTable)?[0m

    # POST /measurements
    ?[32mGiven ?[0m?[32mI have submitted new measurements as follows:?[0m ?[90m# AddMeasurementSteps.givenStatement(DataTable)?[0m

  Scenario: Get a measurement that does not exist           ?[90m# 02-get-measurement.feature:25?[0m
    # GET /measurements/2015-09-01T16:50:00.000Z
    ?[33mWhen ?[0m?[33mI get a measurement for "2015-09-01T16:50:00.000Z"?[0m
    ?[36mThen ?[0m?[36mthe response has a status code of 404?[0m              ?[90m# GetMeasurementSteps.invalidInput()?[0m

You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:

@When("^I get a measurement for \"(.*?)\"$")
public void i_get_a_measurement_for(String arg1) throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}
